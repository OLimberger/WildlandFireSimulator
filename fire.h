     * burning, calculating the burn status of a cell using the rate of spread, timestep length and distance
     * to the next vertex. If the fire reaches a new vertex, its coordinates are appended to the point fire
     * source vector. Note that wind direction refers to the direction the wind is blowing to.
     * If all vertices of a cell are reached or the intensity of a fire is zero, the cell is considered burned
     * out and fire effects on the vegetation in the respective are applied.
     * Each ignited point fire source tries to ignite the cells sharing the vertex and calculates its burn
     * status with the remaining time at the particular point fire source.
